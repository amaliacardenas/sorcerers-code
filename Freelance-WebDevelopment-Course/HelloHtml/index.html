      This is another practice website that I am creating for you. I enjoy creating websites. When I am in
      a text editor creating something I feel really engaged. However, when I am taking tutorials, I often times become
      bored because it feels like I am back in school. I learned that I am most comfortable when I am making and building things.
      I often times get bored with sitting in a class room taking notes. It reminds me of grad school.
